# tkinter-pyneapple
This project includes a script for a GUI app, based on Tkinter, that allows the user to: 
- record all the keystrokes and mouse clicks for later execution, 
- merge a batch of PDF files into a single one and 
- quickly access several folders, files and executables at once. 

Additional notes:
- Please be sure to download the *.txt files as well and save them to the same directory as the script.
- You may need to install some of the python module in your machine to run the script, to do so, you can use: 
  pip install [ name of the module ]
